The answer to a question is only as good as the context that has been provided.
If an "Explain application" has been performed, all Java files have been loaded into the context.
If you do not do an "Explain application", WCA does not know anything about the application and can only answer based on the code it knows.
To set the context, you could use the following commands:

Create a list of all relevant files
On Windows, use a command like "dir /s/b *.java > modres_java.txt"
On Linux, use a command like "find ./src -type f | grep java > modres_java.txt"

In chat, use the command "explain all files listed in @modres_java.txt"

Once the files has been interpreted, you can ask questions like:
"what is the purpose of the modres application?"
"what happens if the weather data endpoint is not available?"
and so on.
